A scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor

Usage: niri [OPTIONS] [-- <COMMAND>...]
       niri <SUBCOMMAND>

Subcommands:
  msg          Communicate with the running niri instance
  validate     Validate the config file
  panic        Cause a panic to check if the backtraces are good
  completions  Generate shell completions
  help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [COMMAND]...
          Command to run upon compositor startup

Options:
  -c, --config <CONFIG>
          Path to config file (default: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/niri/config.kdl`).
          
          This can also be set with the `NIRI_CONFIG` environment variable. If both are set, the command line argument takes precedence.

      --session
          Import environment globally to systemd and D-Bus, run D-Bus services.
          
          Set this flag in a systemd service started by your display manager, or when running manually as your main compositor instance. Do not set when running as a nested window, or on a TTY as your non-main compositor instance, to avoid messing up the global environment.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
