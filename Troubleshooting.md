 
Critical error: unable to nixos switch because Home manager times out because of mutability or something, will have to revisit:
but this command fixes it ```rm -rf ~/.config/hyde/themes \
       ~/.config/hyde/wallbash \
       ~/.local/share/hyde \
       ~/.local/share/wallbash \
       ~/.local/share/waybar/styles \
       ~/.vscode/extensions/prasanthrangan.wallbash```
